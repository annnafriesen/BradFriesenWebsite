# Website for Brad Friesen, Lawyer & Notary

### ... yes, he's my father
___
### üí° __How it Started__  
After 35 years of running a one-man law practice, my dad still didn't have an updated website. He deserved something better and I wanted to learn a new technical skill, 
so I decided to code a new website for him from scratch.  
I wanted to create something that reflected his professionalism and expertise, something that he could confidently refer people to.   
I also wanted to create something that would teach me something new and challenge my technical skills, something that I was proud to have built.  
  
The end product, this code, is a few months of late nights, lots of "inspect element", and learning how to create a unique design that reflects a specific person. 
Unlike other technical projects, this website was personal. My dad works harder than anyone I know, so I wanted to create something that illustrated his commitment to his clients. 

### üñãÔ∏è __My Process__
I started this project with no knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript. Luckily, the start of this project coincided with my first co-op at UBC EdTech which 
increased my motivation to teach myself these languages. To learn the basics, I took Codeacademy courses for all three languages. However, I adopted a "learn by doing" mindset and
just jumped in with both feet.   

I created an original design for the website using Figma. The colour scheme consisted of my dad's favourite navy, with accents of vibrant yellow and deep turquoise. I tried to make the 
design professional, minimalistic, and engaging which meant lots of clean lines and clear blocks of content. 
  
Considering that many of my dad's clientele are elderly, I paid close attention to the accessibility and visual cleanliness of the design. I achieved this in the following features: 
* an easy-to-read, web-friendly font (Times New Roman) and larger font-size
* navigation buttons that direct users to important information on different pages (ie. a "Contact Me" button that redirects to the Contact page)
* an email icon that, when clicked, opens up an email to Brad Friesen on the user's computer
* an embedded map that, when clicked, shows the location of Brad's office on Google Maps
* a clear colour contrast between text and background colours
