            </div>
            <p class="sub-text"> I am a lawyer and notary public based in Oak Bay, British Columbia. I received a
                Bachelor
                of Arts (1983) and a Law Degree from U.B.C. (1986). 2023 marks my 35th year as a practicing lawyer in
                BC.
                <br>
                <br>
                My practice is focused on the issues that people face on a regular basis: whether you are buying or
                selling
                your home, preparing a Will, looking to incorporate your new business, creating an agreement with your
                soon-to-be spouse or handling an Estate – these are all matters for which I am able to offer my
                assistance.

                <p class="sub_sub_content">The hallmark of my community-based service is to provide high quality, reliable
                    legal services to my clients. My commitment to you is to be readily accessible, highly efficient,
                    and reasonably priced. I measure my success by the degree of satisfaction achieved by my clients,
                    and by the contribution I have made to the community in which I live and work. </p>
