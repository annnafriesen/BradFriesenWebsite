# Website for Brad Friesen, Lawyer & Notary

### ... yes, he's my father

### üí° __How it Started__  
After 35 years of running a one-man law practice, my dad still didn't have an updated website. He deserved something better and I wanted to learn a new technical skill, 
so I decided to code a new website for him from scratch.  
I wanted to create something that reflected his professionalism and expertise, something that he could confidently refer people to.   
I also wanted to create something that would teach me something new and challenge my technical skills, something that I was proud to have built.  
  
The end product, this code, is a few months of late nights, lots of "inspect element", and learning how to create a unique design that reflects a specific person. 
Unlike other technical projects, this website was personal. My dad works harder than anyone I know, so I wanted to create something that illustrated his commitment to his clients. 

### üñãÔ∏è __My Process__
I started this project with no knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript. Luckily, the start of this project coincided with my first co-op at UBC EdTech which 
increased my motivation to teach myself these languages. To learn the basics, I took beginner to intermediate Codecademy courses for all three languages. However, I adopted a "learn by doing" mindset and just jumped in with both feet.   

I created an original design for the website using Figma, keeping the photos taken for the old site. The colour scheme consisted of my dad's favourite navy, with accents of vibrant yellow and deep turquoise. I tried to make the design professional, minimalistic, and engaging which meant lots of clean lines and a clear separation of content. 
  
Considering that many of my dad's clientele are elderly, I paid close attention to the accessibility and visual cleanliness of the design. I achieved this in the following features: 
* an easy-to-read, web-friendly font (Times New Roman) and larger font-size
* navigation buttons that direct users to important information on different pages (ie. a "Contact Me" button that redirects to the Contact page)
* an email icon that, when clicked, opens up an email to Brad Friesen on the user's computer
* an embedded map that, when clicked, shows the location of Brad's office on Google Maps
* a clear colour contrast between text and background colours

Another important aspect of this project was ensuring all pages were web-responsive. My dad's old website was not web-responsive, which may not have been a big issue 10 years ago, but 
nowadays many people are accessing his website on their phones. I thought about how to adapt the design for each page for different screen sizes so the content fits the screen appropriately __and__ maintains a clean aesthetic. This involved: 
* adding media queries for various screen sizes, including screens min 1024px, max 509px, and max 480px.
* ensuring content blocks with an image and text were flex boxes that changed from a row layout to a column layout depending on the screen size
* adding a dynamic "hamburger" menu for smaller screen sizes to allow for easy access and readability of the navigation
* manipulating the "Services" blocks so they changed from a 2x2 grid to a stacked row, allowing for better readability and more white space
* stacking the items in the footer vertically so the font size was large enough to read for those with impaired vision

### ‚åõÔ∏è __How it Ended__
Funny enough, I finished the project on Father's Day!
