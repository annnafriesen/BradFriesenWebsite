# Website for Brad Friesen, Lawyer & Notary

### ... yes, he's my father
___
### üí° __How it Started__  
After 35 years of running a one-man law practice, my dad still had no updated website. He deserved something better and I wanted to learn a new technical skill, 
so I decided to code him a new website from scratch.  
I wanted to create something that reflected his professionalism and expertise, something that he could confidently refer people to.   
I also wanted to create something that would teach me something new and challenge my technical skills, something that I was proud to have built.  
  
The end product, this code, is a few months of late nights, lots of "inspect" element, and learning how to create a unique design that reflects a specific person. 
Unlike other technical projects, this website was personal. My dad works harder than anyone I know, so I wanted to create something that illustrated his commitment to his clients. 

### üñãÔ∏è __My Process__
I started this project with no knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript. Luckily, the start of this project coincided with my first co-op at UBC EdTech which 
increased my motivation to teach myself these languages.
